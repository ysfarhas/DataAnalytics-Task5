Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to uncover insights about passenger survival through data summaries and visualizations.

Files Included:

Titanic_EDA_Notebook.ipynb – A complete Jupyter Notebook with all steps of the EDA

Titanic_EDA_Report_Final.pdf – A PDF report with visualizations and key observations

Key Insights:

Female passengers were much more likely to survive than males.

Passengers in first class had a better chance of survival compared to those in lower classes.

Younger passengers and those who paid higher fares had higher survival rates.

Most passengers boarded from Southampton, but those who boarded from Cherbourg had better survival rates.

Tools Used:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

How to Get Started:

Download or clone this repository to your computer.

Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.

Run the cells to explore the data and visuals.
